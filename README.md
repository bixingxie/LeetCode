# LeetCode Practices 

A personal repo for programming practices and learning purposes. Solutions will be mainly in Python and C++. 

## Directory

* [array](./array)
* [binary search](./binary%20search)
* [dp](./dp)
* [hash table](./hash%20table) 
* [linked list](./linked%20list)
* [miscellaneous](./miscellaneous)
* [stack](./stack) 
* [string](./string) 
* [two pointers](./two%20pointers)

## Notes

* 4: Median of Two Sorted Arrays (to do)
* 5: Longest Palindromic String (to solve again using dp)
* 22. Generate Parentheses (to solve again, backtracking)
* 23. Merge k Sorted Lists (to solve again, using priority queue)
